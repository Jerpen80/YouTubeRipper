# 🎵 Jeroen's YouTube Ripper

A lightweight Python command-line tool to extract and convert audio from YouTube videos into MP3 files using **yt-dlp** and **FFmpeg**.

This project started as a learning exercise to practice Python scripting, argument parsing, and working with external command-line utilities — and it turned into a handy little utility that works great for personal use.
